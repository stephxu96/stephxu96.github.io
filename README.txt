I've created a personal website with three html pages and one stylesheet. No front end framework or JavaScript is used to implement the webpages, nor are styling elements and attributes used in the html files. I believe all aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented.

I completed the assignment with the help from Tommy Tang's presentation on flexbox and other TAs

Approximately 12 hours have been spent completing this assignment.
