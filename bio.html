After spending the unparalleled four years of self-exploration in Madaba, Jordan, away from families and homeland, Steph is currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Biotechnology at Tufts University, located in the Great Boston area. Although a political science enthusiast and human rights activist, Steph has rooted her greatest passion in science and technology, as she is now an undergraduate computational chemistry researcher in the Tufts Lin's Lab. There, she is working on the Cyclic Peptide Project funded by National Institute of Health and National Institute of General Medical Sciences, which aims to utilize computational methods towards understanding and designing cyclic peptides, an important biological structure that affects protein-protein interactions in human bodies.</p>
